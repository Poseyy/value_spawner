# Spawner Value vs Quality Demo

Try out the Spawner API to perform analysis using ffn, Plotly, and Spawner.

You can get an API token here: [Spawner](https://spawner.ai).

## Getting Started

Using a python3 environment, run the following to install all the libraries used in this repository:
```
pip install spawner -U
```
If you don't already have plotly and ffn you'll need to install those as well. 
```
pip install plotly ffn 
```
